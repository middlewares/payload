Parses the body of the request if it's not parsed and the method is POST, PUT or DELETE. It contains the following components to support different formats:

* [JsonPayload](#jsonpayload)
* [UrlEncodePayload](#urlencodepayload)
* [CsvPayload](#csvpayload)
* [XmlPayload](#xmlpayload)

Failure to parse the body will result in a `Middlewares\Utils\HttpErrorException` being thrown. See [middlewares/utils](https://github.com/middlewares/utils#httperrorexception) for additional details.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.2
* A [PSR-7 http library](https://github.com/middlewares/awesome-psr15-middlewares#psr-7-implementations)
* A [PSR-15 middleware dispatcher](https://github.com/middlewares/awesome-psr15-middlewares#dispatcher)

## Installation

This package is installable and autoloadable via Composer as [middlewares/payload](https://packagist.org/packages/middlewares/payload).

```sh
composer require middlewares/payload
```

## JsonPayload

Parses the JSON payload of the request.

```php
Dispatcher::run([
    (new Middlewares\JsonPayload())
        ->associative(false)
        ->depth(64)
]);

$response = $dispatcher->dispatch(new ServerRequest());
```

Contains the following options to configure the [json_decode](http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-decode.php) function:

### associative

Enabled by default, convert the objects into associative arrays.

```php
//Disable associative arrays
$payload = (new Middlewares\JsonPayload())->associative(false);
```

### depth

To configure the recursion depth option of json_decode. By default is `512`.

### options

To pass the bitmask of json_decode options: `JSON_BIGINT_AS_STRING` (enabled by default), `JSON_OBJECT_AS_ARRAY`, `JSON_THROW_ON_ERROR`.

### methods

To configure the allowed methods. By default only the requests with the method `POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, COPY, LOCK, UNLOCK` are handled.

```php
//Parse json only with POST and PUT requests
$payload = (new Middlewares\JsonPayload())->methods(['POST', 'PUT']);
```

### contentType

To configure all `Content-Type` headers allowed in the request. By default is `application/json`

```php
//Parse json only in request with these two Content-Type values
$payload = (new Middlewares\JsonPayload())->contentType(['application/json', 'text/json']);
```

### override

To override the previous parsed body if exists (`false` by default)


## UrlEncodePayload

Parses the url-encoded payload of the request.

```php
Dispatcher::run([
    new Middlewares\UrlEncodePayload()
]);
```

### methods
